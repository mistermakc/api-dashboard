# REST API Documentation - Flask-RestX

This document highlights the REST API built using Flask-RestX for a web application that visualizes KPIs for H&M aggregated through article, transaction, and customer data.

Try the API: [H&M API](api.maxharrison.de)

## Overview

To improve the request time for the API, dedicated KPI tables have been created by using the underyling three main datafiles. This REST API is designed to provide access to the following resources:

  - Sales Growth
  - Average Order Value
- **Marketing**
  - Fashion News Effectiveness
  - Fashion News Frequency
- **Resources**

This includes operations for fetching the given resources, including error handling. The API uses as a predefined API key for authentication and authorization: `IEMCSBT23`.
