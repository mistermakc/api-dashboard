# Capstone project

This repository contains the code for the capstone project. The project's objective is to establish a data visualization dashboard, 
which includes understanding and cleaning the dataset, deploying a database solution (e.g. MySQL), integrating a back-end service for the API and 
developing a front-end.

The structure of this repository is as follows:
- **API**
  - Developed with Flask-RestX
  - To deliver data, an API-key in the header is required
  - The API connects to a MySQL database in the Google Cloud
  > Deployed with Google Cloud (App Engine)
- **App/ Client**
  - Developed with Pandas, Streamlit, and Streamlit Authenticator
  - To view the visualized data, a username and password is required
  - Allows for data analysis and insight generation
  > Deployed with Streamlit Cloud (through GitHub repository)
- **Architecture**
  - Holistic overview of the solution's architecture
- **Data**
  - Individual data files: customers, transactions, and articles (csv format)
- **Data Cleaning + Upload**
  - Developed with Pandas 
  - Cleaned to avoid duplicates, missing values, or various variable-content definitions (e.g. NONE, None, none)
- **KPIs**
  - Developed with Pandas
  - Uploaded as individual tables to the database to increase the request time

> **More detailed documentation about the api and app can be found in their respective folders (README)**
